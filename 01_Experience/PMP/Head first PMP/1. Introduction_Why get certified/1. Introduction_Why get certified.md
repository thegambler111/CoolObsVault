# TLDR

## [[#Portfolio - Program - Project|Portfolio - Program - Project]]
- A **portfolio** is a collection of projects or programs linked together by a business goal.
- A **program** is a collection of projects that should be managed together in order to achieve a specific goal or benefit to the company
- A **project** gathers a team together to do work that’s temporary, creates a unique result, and is progressively elaborated.
	- Projects are not ongoing, not always successful and not always strategic or critical
- An **operation** (or **process**) is work that’s done in a way that’s repeatable and ongoing, but is not a project

## [[#Charter| Project charter]]
- A **project charter** is a document that describes a project’s requirements, known constraints, goals and high-level schedule, assigns a project manager, and authorizes the project.

## [[#Project lifecycle|Project lifecycle]]
- **Predictive** lifecycles are predicting what will happen, making plan and following it
- **Adaptive** lifecycles are repeatedly performing all project activities to deliver small pieces of the project called increments that **have value** to stakeholders
- **Iterative** lifecycles making plan up front but using repeated loops within the lifecycle
- **Incremental** lifecycles are close to adaptive ones but each increment is not a final product and needs to be combined together
- **Hybrid** lifecycles are any combination of predictive and adaptive approaches

## [[#Three core characteristics of a successful project manager|Three core PM characteristics]]
- **Knowledge**, **performance**, and **personal skills** are the three areas that project managers focus on to get better at their jobs

# The PMBOK Guide 
- The PMBOK Guide contains generally recognized good practices for dealing with problems that happen on nearly every project
	- Learn from past projects that have run into similar problems to avoid running into them again.
	- Learn a common vocabulary for project management that is used by PMs around the world
	- Plan and execute your projects to avoid common pitfalls.
- PMBOK Guide is a reference book, a framework, not a recipe for a successful project
	-  It contains a lot of (but not all) information about how project managers do their jobs
	- It provides you with a framework for managing projects and tells you what information you need to know.
	- It is a broad collection of many tools and processes that are used across the project management profession




# Portfolio - Program - Project
![[01_Experience/PMP/Head first PMP/1. Introduction_Why get certified/Portfolio - Program - Project.png]]

- Definition:
	- Portfolio: A portfolio is a group of projects,  programs and other things like sub portfolios and operations that are linked together by a business goal
	- Program: A program is a group of projects that are closely linked
	- Project: A project is any work that has a beginning and an end, and produces a specific result 
- Manager jobs:
	- Portfolio managers divide up the projects, programs, and operations your company is doing so that they align with business goals
	- Program managers focus on the places where projects depend on each other and coordinate activities to make sure that the work gets done in the most direct way possible
	- Project managers keep the team focused on the business value the project is providing and make sure that everyone on the team makes the best decisions to keep the project on track
- Priority:
	- Portfolio managers prioritize work to meet a company’s strategic goals
	- Program managers ensure that groups of projects can achieve some shared benefit by keeping track of all of their constraints
	- Projects are about managing the work to achieve some result.
- Deal with constraints:
	- Portfolio managers need to prioritize work in environments with limited resources, budgets, risk tolerance, and many other constraints that set up the environment for their portfolio’s success.
	- Program managers need to manage groups of projects that are being produced by the same resource pool or from the same budget. 
	- Project managers often have predefined schedules, resource constraints, and scope requirements to manage.
- Similarities:
	- Portfolio managers and program managers also have a set of proven processes, tools, and techniques
	- A portfolio’s strategic goals, a program's shared benefit, and the result of that project all add business value to your company.
	- All three need to use the processes, tools, and techniques to balance all of the constraints in their business environments.



# Charter

- Portfolios, programs, and projects all use a charter to define their goals and initiate work
- A charter lists any known constraints and goals and gives the manager authority to get the work started.
	- A portfolio charter lays out the strategic benefits and lists all of the included programs and projects
	- A program charter defines the shared benefit that the program is achieving as well as the list of projects it includes.
	- A project charter gives a project description, summary schedule, and business case, and assigns a project manager.
- Portfolio performance = combined performance of all programs and projects
- Successful project = met requirements + a high quality product



# Project lifecycle

- Each organization has a unique culture and set of considerations that affect all of the dimensions of project planning and execution.


## Predictive
![[01_Experience/PMP/Head first PMP/1. Introduction_Why get certified/Predictive life cycle.png]]
- Predictive lifecycles are all about predicting what will happen, preparing the best plan possible, and then working to follow it.
- In predictive lifecycles, the project's schedule, scope, and costs are defined up front. 
- The project team does its best to execute the plan and minimize the impact of changes as they happen


## Adaptive
![[01_Experience/PMP/Head first PMP/1. Introduction_Why get certified/Adaptive life cycle.png]]
- Adaptive lifecycles are all about change
- Teams repeatedly perform all project activities to deliver small pieces of the project called increments that **have value** to its stakeholders
- After each iteration, there is an opportunity for feedback and for changing the scope without disrupting the work


## Iterative

- Iterative lifecycles are closer to predictive lifecycles than adaptive ones
- The team still tries to plan most of the work up front but uses repeated loops within the project lifecycle to identify possible changes 

## Incremental

- Incremental development lifecycles are much closer to adaptive ones
- Each increment is a small, usable pieces of work but cannot be considered a final product
- Those increments must be combined in a final iteration to be considered complete


## Hybrid

- The term hybrid describes any combination of predictive and adaptive approaches


# Project

- Projects are temporary, they always have a start and a finish, and are never ongoing.
	- Start when you decide what to do
	- Finish when a product is created or you decide to stop
- Each project creates a **unique** result
	- The product is measurable
- Projects are progressively elaborated
	- You learn more and more about a project as it goes on
	- As new information comes, you have to make decisions to keep the project on track
- Projects are: 
	- NOT always strategic or critical
	- NOT ongoing operations (or processes)
		- Operations and processes are work that never ends
	- NOT always successful


# Three core characteristics of a successful project manager

- Knowledge
	- Learn from everyone's successes and mistakes
	- Know a wide range of project management tools, techniques and when, how to use them
- Performance
	- Work hard to deliver a successful project
- Personal skills
	- Make personal connection with your team
	- Help keep everybody on the right track


# Project manager

## Daily PM work

	- You are always finding more as you go
	- This additional information sometimes brings changes to your product
- Manage [[01_Experience/Glossary/Project stakeholder/Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] expectations
	- There are a lot of people involved in making most projects happen
	- Those people are called your stakeholders
		- One of the most important stakeholders is the sponsor who provides financial and political support
	- And a big part of the PM's job is using your interpersonal and team skills to:
		- Communicate with everybody
		- Keep them on the same page
		- Make sure their needs are met

	- Constraints make the job more challenging
	- However, that is daily work of a project manager

## Common processes in every projects
- The PMBOK Guide describes 49 processes your project will go through from start to finish.
