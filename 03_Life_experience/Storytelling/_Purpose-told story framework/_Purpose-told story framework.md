# Purpose-told story framework
- “The arc of the purpose-told story guides the consumer from an absence in her life to its fulfillment, from need to satisfaction.”
- The brilliant part of McKee’s process?
	- It’s built outside in.
		- He starts with the end – your audience, their problem, and the desired action.
		- Then he figures out the beginning – the event to trigger the story.
		- Last, you build the narrative arc to connect beginning and end.
- McKee lays out his 8 stages for great business storytelling.

# 1. The 3 Targets
- Before considering your story, you must understand your:
	- Target audience – who you’re talking to
	- Target need – what problem they have your product solves
	- Target action – what you want them to do
- Without defining those three, you’re guessing.

# 2. Subject Matter
- The constraints and subjects that make up your story.
- McKee breaks it into 3 components:
	- Core value – the value your brand couldn’t exist without
	- Protagonist – the Hero your audience empathizes with
	- Setting – society, time, and place

# 3. The Inciting Incident
- Launch the story by throwing the protagonist’s life out of whack.
- Your goal is two-fold:
	- Grab your audience’s attention
	- Propel the protagonist to action
- McKee says, “fine storytellers seek out the negative side of life.”

# 4. The Object of Desire
- An unfulfilled need the protagonist feels they need to get their life back on track
- That happens to be fulfilled by your product / service.
- McKee says the most compelling objects come with the highest price tags.

# 5. First Action
- The tactical choice the protagonist makes to re-balance their life.
- This cannot succeed. That’d be too easy.
- Introduce antagonists – anything keeping the protagonist from the object of desire.

# 6. The First Reaction
- The reaction to the First Action should be different or more powerful than expected.
- This gap in expectation vs. reality leaves space for the protagonist to gain insight.
- Two key aspects:
	- Violation of expectations
	- Turning points

# 7. Crisis Choice
- The moment of truth – this final action must be more risky than the first.
- It’s now or never.
- The protagonist will either re-balance their life or remain in chaos.

# 8. Climactic Reaction
- The protagonist gets their life back on track.
- Neuroscientists find the brain’s response to a good story’s climax is a few seconds of heightened memory.
- McKee recommends putting your logo right after the climax to take advantage of this.
