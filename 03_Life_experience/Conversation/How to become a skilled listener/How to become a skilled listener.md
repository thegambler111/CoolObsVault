# The Samaritans Framework:
- The Samaritans Framework was developed for high-stakes conversations—Helplines—but can be applied to any conversation.

# 1. Open-Ended Questions
- Open questions get to the root cause of peoples feelings.
- Example:
	- How did that make you feel?
	- What are your thoughts on that?
- These:
	- Take assumptions off the table
	- Elicit thoughtful answers
	- Allow you to connect on a far deeper level

# 2. Summarizing
- This is a simple way to check your understanding.
- Example:
	- Let me make sure I understand…
	- Just to be clear, you’re saying that…
- Then repeat a quick summary of what you heard.
- If there are any misunderstandings on your end, this will clear them up.

# 3. Reflecting
- Reflecting prevents you from inserting your own ideas into a conversation.
- Example:
	- They might say, “My mom hates me.”
	- And you could say, “Hates you?”
- This helps creates space for them to remain comfortable and talking.

# 4. Clarifying
- Clarifying questions
	- Help others process their feelings
	- Provide further context for you to understand.
- Example:
	- Could you clarify
	- Would you elaborate on
	- Could you be more explicit about
- Both parties will be clear about what is being said and why.

# 5. Short Words of Encouragement
- Encouraging words put the “active” in the “active listening.”
- Example:
	- Phrases like “ah,” “mhmm,” “yes,” and “true” show you’re engaged and attentive.
- Listening in silence offers no clues that you’re listening or understanding.

# 6. Reacting
- Reacting is showing a genuine response to let the speaker know you empathize with them.
- Example:
	- Them: “We won the tournament!”
	- You: “Hell yeah, you did!”
- Meet them where they're at.
	- If they're excited, be excited.
	- If they're calm, be calm.
