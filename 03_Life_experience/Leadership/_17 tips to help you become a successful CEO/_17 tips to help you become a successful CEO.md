# Make individuals successful
- Your main job as CEO is to make the company successful.
- You do this by helping your talented employees succeed.
- Give them:
	- Encouragement
	- Clear feedback
	- Mentorship
	- New ideas
	- Pushback
- When they win, the company wins.

# Influence others with your example
- If you expect long hours from employees, put them in yourself.
- If you expect hard problems to be solved, solve hard problems yourself.
- If you expect over-communication, you have to do it, too.
- It all starts with you.

# Know your stage and needs
- Companies need different things at different times:
	- Build a great product
	- Create a category
	- Access liquidity
	- Scale growth
	- Raise funds
- These jobs are all different.
- Don't do all at once.

# Limit "fires" over time
- Early days, you need to personally put out "fires".
- But you need to become so good at creating processes that:
	- Fires become less common
	- Others know how to handle them
	- Fires become a breeding ground for growth

# Work alongside the team
- Employees want to see your boots on the ground.
	- Strategize with them.
	- Build processes alongside them.
	- Execute on the work in tandem.
- There's power in collaboration from the CEO.

# Become great at finding talent
- Nothing impacts a company more than the people.
	- Put the wrong people in, and it can all crash down.
	- Put the right people in, and you may build a unicorn.
- Your job is to know who will crush it in any given role.

# Develop promising talent
- Look at the more junior people at the company.
	- There are potential superstars there.
	- You need to identify who they are, what they could learn, and where they will go.
- Nothing beats developing talent in-house.

# Build a small team, not a big one
- Your company probably doesn't need 10,000 people.
- Small teams build faster and more collaboratively.
- And speed is the name of the game for startups.

# Never stagnate
- If you're not growing, you're dying.
- Momentum is a fickle thing.
- You need to actively build, grow, and push boundaries in the industry.
- If not, you will fall backwards slowly at first, then rapidly.

# Don't expect mind reading
- No one knows what you're thinking.
	- They don't know what you want to test.
	- They don't know what you want to improve on.
- Communicate this clearly, or don't be mad when things are done below your expectations.

# Guard your calendar
- Being busy with meetings is NOT a sign of productivity.
- Host meetings that:
	- Have an agenda
	- Are well planned
	- Have a clear goal
	- Include a working session
- Otherwise, guard your time and communicate with email.

# Repeat important principles
- We're all goldfish.
- We won't remember anything unless it's emphasized often.
- This applies to:
	- Company vision
	- Company mission
	- Quarterly goals
- Talk about them often.

# Default to "yes" early, and "no" later
- Early days, you have to make things happen.
	- You need to say "yes" to a lot of tasks you don't wanna do.
- As time goes on, you need to guard your time more wisely.
	- Say "no" to most meetings, asks, and tasks.

# Don't change the past, change the future
- The past won't change.
- What's done is done.
- But you can still change future outcomes.
- Focus there and make wiser choices going forward.

# Unlearn useless knowledge and habits
- The habits that you relied on in Year 1 of your company were helpful.
	- But many become outdated as the company grows.
- Unlearn old habits and adapt to new situations.
	- Don't be afraid to scrap knowledge.

# Strategize on a long time horizon
- Plan as if it's 20 years away.
	- Dream bigger than your wildest expectations.
- Build a strategy that assumes massive long-term success.

# Execute on a short time horizon
- Break down your massive vision into bite-sized pieces.
	- Take immediate, digestible action daily.
- Your strategy may take 20 years, but you can contribute to that right now.
