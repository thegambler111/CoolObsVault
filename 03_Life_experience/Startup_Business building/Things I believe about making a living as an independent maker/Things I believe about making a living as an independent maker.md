# The best way to build an audience is to simply be helpful on the internet.
- Give people a reason to pay attention to you, and keep your signal to noise ratio high.
- Better to tweet 4 good ideas per week than 10 useful ideas + a bunch of BS about how Starbucks screwed up your order.

# Giving away your work for free is like compressing a spring that releases when you finally put something up for sale.
- The longer you do it, the more energy is released.
- Steve and I compressed the Refactoring UI spring for over two years.
	- It made $1,000,000 in the first month.

# Marketing doesn’t have to feel gross.
- Sharing what you’re working on, writing about the behind-the-scenes process, and documenting hard problems you’ve solved is all marketing, and people are *excited* to see that sort of stuff, not put off by it.

# Marketing a product after it’s released is way harder than marketing it before you launch.
- You need to start marketing at the very beginning, when all of the exciting development is happening and you have lots of interesting things to share.

# Ignoring people who are critical of your work is not “creating an echo chamber”, it’s building a community.
- You wouldn’t tell Slayer to write songs for the people who don’t like Slayer.
- Find the people who love what you’re doing and spend your attention on them, ignore the rest.

# Analytics are overrated.
- I’ve never once made a decision that was informed by open rates or traffic sources.
	- In fact Tailwind UI has no website analytics at all.
- Doing great work has always been a more efficient lever for me.

# Build real friendships, not a “network”
- People who want to help you > people you ask to help you.
- I’ve never had to ask anyone to help promote my work.

# Work in public.
- Tailwind only exists because a bunch of people seemed excited about some boring CSS files I was using when I was live-streaming some work on a completely different project.
- I never would have seen the potential on my own.

# Always think long-term.
- Early in my entrepreneurial career, I made a lot of short-sighted decisions about time-limited deals, and other urgency/scarcity based marketing strategies.
- It made me look like a scummy internet marketer and I will never do that again.

# Pick a “business hero” and ask yourself “would they do this?” whenever you’re trying to make a tough decision about a marketing tactic.
- For me it’s Basecamp.
- Lots of decisions feel hard for me to make for myself, but are obvious when I ask myself “what would Basecamp do?”

# “Early access” doesn’t have to be cheaper, in fact you can easily make the argument for making it more expensive.
- If I wanted to early access to the unmastered recordings of a new album I was looking forward to would that be cheaper?

# A landing page is the last step in validating an idea, not the first.
- Put your ideas out there as tweets, articles, videos, conference talks, etc. first and see what people are excited about.
- A landing page takes you from 90% confidence in an idea to 95%, not 0% to 100%.

# Compete on quality.
- There are tons of people writing blog posts, making screencasts, open sourcing libraries, etc., but very few people making stuff that’s really *great* from end-to-end.
- Forget the 80/20 rule when it comes to putting out projects. Go the full 100.

# Stand out by doing the hard work that everyone else is too lazy to do. 
- For example, [@reinink](https://twitter.com/reinink) was the 1000th person to write a tutorial on the Eloquent ORM, but he was the first person to bite off the really *hard* problems and do the grueling work to come up with good answers.

# Learning is more important than your ego.
- I ask for help about dumb shit on Twitter all the time, no one thinks I’m stupid and I have grown 100x as a result.
- I literally started a podcast just to get people to explain things to me that I didn’t fully understand.
