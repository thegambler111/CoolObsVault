# Pitch deck
A pitch deck is a brief presentation that gives potential investors or clients an overview of your business plan, products, services and growth traction.

# The framework
- The best decks tackle the following:
	- Company purpose
	- Problem
	- Solution
	- Team
	- Product
	- Biz Model
	- Market/TAM
	- Financials
	- Competitors

## Declare an enemy
- You want to create common ground immediately in a pitch.
	- Don't make it "Your Company vs The Investors".
	- Make it "All of Us vs The Problem".
- Put the investors on your side ASAP.
- E.g. The common enemy for Tesla is fossil fuels.

## Clarify the problem
- No one will invest without understanding the real problem you solve.
- You have to give clarity on:
	- What the problem is
	- Who it affects
	- What current solutions exist
	- Why those solutions are failing
- Then explain why you're the best at solving it
- Investors love seeing founders solving a personal pain point.
	- "I couldn't find a solution for X issue so I created Y"
	- Having a personal problem you are trying to solve makes you the customer.

## Accentuate your social proof
- If you have:
	- High User Engagement
	- Product Market Fit
	- A dynamic team
	- Proven sales
- Highlight this in your deck.
	- Investors want to know you have momentum and opportunities outside of their investment.

## Sell the benefits
- Investors want to know the benefits your product brings to the market.
	- These benefits highlight the real opportunity.
	- e.g. Figure: no more 8 hour days & high attrition, robots can work 20 hours a day.

## Talk long-term
- Investors need to know that this is a 10-year (minimum) project for you and your team.
	- Commit by showing your massive plans, broken down by milestones.
	- E.g. Year 1: we will accomplish X, Year 5: we will accomplish Y, etc.

## Give succinct data
- Have every bit of data in your back pocket, but only show the key notes.
	- If you show everything, none of it will bear weight in the pitch.
	- If you show the most important points, it will stick in investors' minds.
- Pro Tip: Bring a pitch deck to meetings with an extended Appendix.
	- The Appendix includes answers to every possible question you might encounter.
	- Over time as you field new questions, add them to the Appendix.

## Customize your format
- Meeting with Sequoia? They have a recommended format.
- Chatting with First Round? They could have a different pitch deck preference.
- Research if the Partner has a recommended deck format, and use it.
- They're telling you how they think. Align with them

## Talk openly about risk
- Investors know that every opportunity is risky.
- You aren't going to trick them into thinking otherwise.
- But you can show that you:
	- Have thought your idea through
	- Believe you will overcome the risks
	- Are realistic (enough) about your company
