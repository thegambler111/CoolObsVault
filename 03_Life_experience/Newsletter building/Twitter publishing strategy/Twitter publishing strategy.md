# I Built My Publishing Habit Each AM:
- In October of 2021, I committed to publishing daily on Twitter.
	- That carried into 2022.
- I started with a "Happy {Day} to X" Tweet each AM.
- I had 2 goals:
	1. Continue my Tweeting habit.
	2. Put my name & face in front of people daily.

# Shared Educational Tweets Each PM:
- Each afternoon, I shared a lesson from my solopreneur journey.
- Topics included:
	- Audience growth
	- Service businesses
	- Building info products
	- Using social media effectively
- I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.

# Wrote A Step-By-Step Thread 1x Per Week:
- Weekly threads powered my growth.

- I gained thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.

- My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.

# Commented Underneath Large Accounts:

	- Find interesting, large accounts
	- Set up automatic notifications
	- Read each of their Tweets
	- Add valuable comments
	- Engage

# Eliminated The "Touch Base" Tweets:
- By March 2022, I had a publishing habit.

	- So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.
	
	- They weren't adding much value.

- I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets, and writing more threads.
