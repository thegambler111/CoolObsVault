# TLDR
- The 6-pager is a very detailed and always data-proven plan
- Read short version to understand the 6-pager and long version to know how to create one

# The 6-page memos short version
- Operational plan has 6 components:
	- Intro
	- Goals
	- Tenets
	- Current state
	- Lessons learned
	- Strategy
- The structure is like that of a story.
	- Intro = Hook
	- Goals and Tenets = Stakes
	- State = Setting and Backstory
	- Lessons and Strategic priorities = Plot

## The 6 components

### Introduction
- Set up precisely what the material is going to **cover**
- State the general **direction** of where the document plans on going.

### Goals
- What the **metrics for success**
	- -> Use them as lens to see the remaining document through.

### Tenets
- This is a very Amazon thing where every action has some clearly defined north star.
- Generally, they are **inspirational pillars** that the rest of the plan sits on top of

### State of the business
- What is the current state of the business.
- There needs to be a lot of **detail**
- Sets up the points to **compare** against in the next section.

### Lessons learned
- Outline the current state of the business and its **influence** on creating the goals
- It should be **detailed** enough
	- So the reader can understand the **positive and negative** activities in the prior period.

### Strategic priorities
- This is the meat of the document
- Lays out the **plan** and how to **execute** it
- **Match** up to achieving the **goals** stated at the top of the document.

## Why?
- Bezos made Amazon into a writing culture by banning powerpoint. He forcing everyone to write 6-page memos (called “narratives”) for meetings.
	- The narrative structure forces
		- Better thought
		- Better understanding.
	- PPT-style presentations
		- Give permission to gloss over ideas
		- Flatten out any sense of relative importance
		- Ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.
- To put it simply, you write the story of whatever is being discussed in the meeting.
	- This is hard on the presenter, but much easier on the audience.
		- A reversal of the usual meeting.
- Writing a narrative forces a deep understanding of the ideas presented.
	- Errors in your setting, people notice.
	- Errors in your plot, people notice.
	- Errors in your logic, people notice.
	- This idea is as true for business writing as it is for fantasy.
- To me, Amazon’s writing and narrative focus does three things:
	1. Prioritizes clear thinking
	2. Puts idea generation on the individual
	3. Makes knowledge transfer easy
	- Plus, imagine how many pointless calls you’d eliminate if the call owner had to write a six-page paper.

# The 6-page memos long version
- There are different approaches based on the goal of the document
- The memos below is an operational plan document.
	- These are 6-month plans that outline
		- the current state of the business
		- the historical data from the last period
		- the goals for this period
		- how you plan on achieving them
- These operational plans are usually created by a team, not an individual
- Each 6-pager needs to **stand on its own**
	- No attachment
	- Everyone, even people not familiar with the subject, must understand what is going on without additional research

## General setting
- It took me five days to write, and I did four revisions for my [2020 OP-2 plan for Pixel Vision 8](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&client=webapp&u=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPh1LWx1z67YFo67DENYUGBaoKk39dtX7rWAeQHXzhg/edit?usp%3Dsharing) ([[03_Life_experience/Writing_Sharing is caring/Writing at work/Amazon six-page narratively structured memo/Jesse Freeman – Pixel Vision 8 OP2 Plan 2020|markdown backup]]).
- There is a strict rule around it being exactly six pages.
	- The above plan is written using 10 point font
	- The goal is to fill up all six pages without any filler
- The appendix can be of any length
- The main goal of authoring this kind of document is to craft the entire thing as a narrative
	- In the document’s core 6-pages, there is
		- No bullet-point lists
		- No graphics
		- No fluff
	- These contextual information should be put in appendix to allow reader to choose

## The skeleton
![[#The 6 components]]

## How to write the 6-pager

### The introduction
- I usually try to consolidate my introduction to two paragraphs
	- And added the 3rd paragraph to pack in some extra detail if needed
- You will want to add as much contextual data as possible
	- Because there is a lot of data to process upfront, especially if you’re not familiar with the subject.
- There are no links to any websites
	- Put all information into the appendix in case you need an offline copy

### The goals
- Bullet points are allowed in this part
- Predefined structure:
	- Start with the actual goal, bolded, in as few words as possible
	- Follow with a single sentence that adds context to the goal
	- A historical data point
	- A projected data point
	- An explicit calculation of the change between the two data points
- You want to have at least three goals
- [OKRs](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&client=webapp&u=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) are another popular one

### The tenets
- Bullet points are also allowed in this part
- Excellent tenets can be linked back to the leadership principles somehow
- I think these tenets add nothing to the document

### The state of the business
- This section is about distilling all of the current activities and their intended goals
- There should be a lot of appendix references here
- Keep the information as up to date as possible
	- -> Use present tense
- Keep the data as detailed as possible
	- It should include a full snapshot of weekly report on the business’s health in appendix
- I complete the section with a little summary of everything that has been done and try to tie it into the goals

### Lessons learned
- After summing up the state of the business, it’s time to reflect on what happened in the past
- This is a snapshot from the last period until now
	- It has to be even more factual with
		- Numbers
		- Percentages of goal completion
		- Even additional references in the appendix.
- This section is similar to the state of the business but the tense here is always in the past
- There shouldn’t be any forward projections or expectations
- There is zero room for interpretation. The data will tell the real story
- You are encouraged to **share your failures** along with your successes

### Strategic priorities
- This is the most detailed section
	- This is usually 50–70% of the 6-pager
- This section outlines each activity you plan on doing and how it relates to one of the goals
- You will spend the majority of the meeting defending this section
	- The strategic priorities section is all speculation
	- All other parts (except) telnets are facts
		- -> The only questions you will get are whether the data adds up or the goals are challenging enough
- To prove your proposal, you need to pull numbers from the lessons learned and state of the business
- How to structure these priorities:
	- Prediction:
		- how you will contribute back to a given goal
	- The actual plan
		- Summarize the approach in this section
		- Put tactical execution steps in the appendix

### Ending
- The contents of 6-pager cover exactly to the bottom of page 6
- There is no summary section or closing remarks
- The last sentence ends on a positive, forward-facing note

### The appendix
- The appendix allow reader to choose how deep they want to read
	- The 6-pager narrative gives you a high-level overview
	- The appendix gives you details
- Each person will dig into their areas of expertise and skim over other parts

# How Amazon conducts meetings
- Each attendee gets a print out of the document
	- You’re not allowed to read the document from your computer
- For the first 20 minutes of a 60-minute meeting, Amazon holds silent meetings.
	- Each attendee reads the document, and usually write down questions and feedback
- Then they spend the rest of the meeting tearing apart the ideas it presents.
	- Challenging your position
	- Questioning your tactics
	- Make sure the data is valid
- All print outs are handed back at the end of the meeting
- After the meeting, you need to update and recirculate the document to everyone
