# 1) Curiosity Gap
- Example:
	- Link Whisper Review: Why it's not right for everyone
- The space between what we know and don't know.
	- This framework creates a burning desire to click and uncover key info.
	- "Why It's Not Right For Everyone"
- Use curiosity gap to your advantage. Make people second guess and click to uncover the truth.

# 2) Credibility Statement
- Tell searchers why they should trust your content.
	- ✅ HubSpot Review: 5 Years of Real-World Testing
	- ❌ HubSpot Review: CRM Tool Features
- People want real-world experience, not conjecture.
- Use your credibility to increase CTR.

# 3) Audience Callout
- Speak directly to the target market.
	- ✅ Linkedin Marketing Guide for [New Users]
	- ❌ The Best Linkedin Marketing Guide
- They'll immediately know the content is tailor-made for their needs.

# 4) Timeframe
- Tell searchers a real time-frame and set expectations.
	- ✅ Learn JavaScript in Half The Time: Comprehensive Guide
	- ❌ The Ultimate Guide To Learn JavaScript

# 5) Call Out Other Content
- Most organic search results are the same content pieces, regurgitated. Call this out and show why you deserve the clicks:
	- ✅ XX Guide: What Other Experts Won't Tell You...
	- ❌ Another Boring Guide on XYZ Subject
- Own your unique, expert opinion.

# 6) Metaphor Framework
- Metaphors and catchphrases are cheesy. But they work. They're memorable and sticky. And they drive clicks.
- Use that to your advantage:
	- ✅ XX Review: The [Swiss-Army-Knife] of [Video Software]

# 7) Bonus Item Framework
- Don't just give searchers a boring article.
	- Create content "upgrades" like templates or spreadsheets they can take action with.
- Use that in your title tag:
	- ✅ Step-by-Step Quarterly Finance Guide (+ Free Template!)
